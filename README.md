CBCT Web Viewer

A browser-based application that allows users to upload, process, and view CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) images online for free.
The goal of this project is to create a simple, secure, and intuitive tool for viewing medical volumetric scans directly in the browser - without installing additional software.

Project Status - In Development (Portfolio Project)

Plan to do 12 steps 

**Stage 1 - Define Project Scope**

Clarify the main goal of the application
Define target users (e.g., dentists, patients, student radiologists)
Describe the core use-case: upload + view CBCT scans in the browser
Identify limitations (supported formats, max file size, processing time)

**Results Stage 1 **
1) The primary goal of the application is to provide users with a fully free, simple, fast, and accessible way to upload and view CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scans directly in a web browser, without installing any specialized software.
2) Dental and orthodontic professionals, Radiology and medical students, Patients, and Developers and researchers working with medical imaging.
3) Core use-case:  **User logs in  >>>  ser uploads a CBCT file  >>>  System processes the scan   >>>  Scan appears in the dashboard  >>>  User opens it in the viewer   >>>    User scrolls through slices directly in the browser**
4) Identify limitations
5)    Supported formats: initially DICOM, NRRD, NII.
      Max file size: limited to avoid long uploads (e.g., 200–400 MB).
      Processing time: depends on file size and browser performance; large scans may load slowe.
