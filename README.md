CBCT Web Viewer

A browser-based application that allows users to upload, process, and view CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) images online for free.
The goal of this project is to create a simple, secure, and intuitive tool for viewing medical volumetric scans directly in the browser - without installing additional software.

Project Status - In Development (Portfolio Project)

Plan to do 12 steps 

**Stage 1 - Define Project Scope**

Clarify the main goal of the application
Define target users (e.g., dentists, patients, student radiologists)
Describe the core use-case: upload + view CBCT scans in the browser
Identify limitations (supported formats, max file size, processing time)

**Results Stage 1**
**Main goal:**
Provide users with a fully free, simple, fast, and accessible way to upload and view CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scans directly in a web browser, without installing any specialized software.

**Target users:**
Dental and orthodontic professionals, radiology and medical students, patients, and developers or researchers working with medical imaging.

**Core use-case:**
User logs in → uploads a CBCT file → the system processes the scan → the scan appears in the dashboard → user opens it in the viewer → user scrolls through slices directly in the browser.

**Limitations:**
Supported formats: DICOM, NRRD, NII.
Max file size: approximately 200–400 MB.
Processing time: depends on scan size and browser performance; large files may load slowly.
