# **Stage 5 - Prepare Test Data (HIPAA-Aligned Document)**

The purpose of Stage 5 is to prepare a controlled, safe, and private dataset of CBCT DICOM files for development and testing. Since the project operates in a healthcare-related context, this stage must follow privacy-first principles and avoid handling or exposing any Protected Health Information (PHI).

Although anonymization is not required in your case, all test data must remain strictly local and must never be uploaded or shared publicly.

---

## **1. Collect a Local Set of DICOM CBCT Files**

Prepare several DICOM datasets to cover different development scenarios:

* **Small case (fast testing):**
  A lightweight DICOM series suitable for quick uploads and UI testing.

* **Medium case (performance testing):**
  A larger DICOM series to evaluate loading time and viewer performance.

* **Optional problematic case:**
  A dataset with irregular structure or missing tags for error-handling tests.

All datasets must remain on your local machine only.

---

## **2. Organize Files into a Local Test Directory**

Create a directory structure for easier testing:

```
test-data/
   case-small/
   case-medium/
   case-problem/
```

Each folder should contain the `.dcm` files belonging to a single CBCT series.

This structure is for local development only and must not be tracked by Git.

---

## **3. Verify That Files Are Valid and Readable**

Open each dataset in a DICOM viewer such as:

* RadiAnt
* Horos / OsiriX
* 3D Slicer

Confirm that:

* The files are not corrupted
* The slice order is correct (InstanceNumber or ImagePositionPatient)
* The series contains usable volumetric data

---

## **4. Confirm the Expected DICOM Structure**

CBCT volumes typically come in one of two forms:

1. **Multi-file DICOM series**
   The most common structure, where each `.dcm` file contains one slice.

2. **Single-file DICOM volume**
   Less common, but supported.

For this project, multi-file series provide the best real-world test environment.

---

## **5. Enforce Local Storage and Privacy Requirements**

To conform with privacy-by-design and HIPAA-aligned practices:

* Do not upload DICOM files to GitHub or any cloud service
* Do not share test datasets with third parties
* Ensure `.gitignore` includes:

```
*.dcm
test-data/
storage/
uploads/
```

This prevents accidental exposure of medical imaging data.

---

## **6. Select Primary Test Cases for Development**

Choose which datasets will be used most frequently:

* **Primary case:** small dataset for rapid workflow testing
* **Performance case:** medium dataset for slice rendering tests
* **Error case:** optional, for validating system resilience

This selection helps streamline development and ensures consistency across stages.

---

## **HIPAA-Aligned Considerations**

Even though anonymization is not required for your internal usage, the project follows these principles:

* No PHI is uploaded, stored remotely, or transferred
* All test files reside only on your local machine
* All imaging data is excluded from version control
* No real patient identifiers appear inside the application UI
* Documentation avoids references to personally identifiable health data

These measures ensure that development adheres to responsible handling of medical imaging data.

---

# **Results Stage 5 (Final)**

**Test dataset prepared:**
Local DICOM CBCT files have been organized into clearly defined categories (small, medium, problem cases) for consistent testing.

**Privacy preserved:**
All DICOM files remain on the local machine, are excluded from Git, and are handled in a privacy-first manner.

**Usability confirmed:**
All datasets have been verified in external DICOM viewers to ensure they are readable and suitable for development.

**Development-ready structure:**
A local directory structure has been created for use during upload, parsing, viewer development, and performance testing.
